        <p class="info"><b>Welcome to CCHS's HOSA club!<br>
        HOSA-Future Health Professionals is a national student organization
        advocated by the U.S. Department of Science Education Division of ACTE.
        We have a mission to promote career opportunities in health care and to improve the
        quality of healthcare provided to all people. HOSA members are provided
        with a unique program of leadership development, motivation, and
        recognition exclusively for secondary, post-secondary, adult, and
        collegiate students enrolled in the health science programs.<br>
        <br>
        Chester County High School HOSA club now has 134 members. The main
        mission of our club is to work on the shortage of qualified workers for the
        healthcare industry, and to encourage our students to work hard for
        their goals in the healthcare profession.</b></p>
